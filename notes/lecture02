Why makes a class file at all?
1.Class file has been type checked.Distributed code is safer.
2.Class files are 'simpler' for machine to execute.Ditributed code is faster.
3.Minor benefit:Protects your intellectual property.No need to give out sourve.


---Video2a-defining and instantiating classes---
Every method(function) is associated with some class.
To run a class,we must define a main method.
Not all classes have a main method.


---Video2b-defining and instantianing classes---
Classes can contain not just functions,but also data.

We'll create a single dog class,and then create instances of this dog.
The class provides a blueprint that all dog objects will follow.

Dog.java & doglauncher.java     dependency


---Video2c-terminology---
Declaration-Instantiation-Assignment
The dot notation meaans that we want to use a method or variable belonging to hugedog,or more succinctly,a member of hugedog.


---Video2d-arrays of objects---
1.use the new keyword to create the array
2.use new again for each object that you want to put in the array

Eg.dog[] dogs = new dog[2];
      dog[0]=new dog(8);
      dog[1]=new dog(20);
      dog[0].makeNoise();


---Video3a-static vs instatnce methods---
1.Static methods are invoked using the class name, e.g. Dog.makeNoise();
2.Instance methods are invoked using an instance name, e.g. maya.makeNoise();
3.Static methods can’t access “my” instance variables, because there is no “me”.

Static members are accessed using class name, e.g. Dog.binomen.
Non-static members cannot be invoked using class name: Dog.makeNoise()(wrong)


---Video3b-exercise---
public class DogLoop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
   		Dog smallDog = new Dog(5);
   		Dog mediumDog = new Dog(25);
   		Dog hugeDog = new Dog(150);
 
   		Dog[] manyDogs = new Dog[4];  
        manyDogs[0] = smallDog;
   		manyDogs[1] = hugeDog;    	   
        manyDogs[2] = new Dog(130);
 
   		int i = 0;
   		while (i < manyDogs.length) {
       		Dog.maxDog(manyDogs[i], mediumDog).makeNoise();
       		i = i + 1;
        }
    }
}

---Video5-using libraries---
The built-in java libraries:Math.String.Integer.List.Map
The princeton standard library(StdDraw.StdAudio.In)

Best ways to learn how to use an unfamiliar library:
1.find a tutorial(youtube…)for the library
2.read the documentation for the library
3.look at example code snippets that use the library
